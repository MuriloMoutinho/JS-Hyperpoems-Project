                <h2>MADISON JULIUS CAWEIN</h2>
                <p>Born March 23, 1865, in Louisville, Madison Julius Cawein, Kentucky. From a young age, Julius developed a love for nature, something that was always expressed in his poems.
                    When Madison graduated from high school, he started working at a pool hall in his hometown. Madison worked for 6 years, saving money and resources to be able to return home and work on his art. In his artistic life, he published 36 books and 1,500 poems and earned the nickname "Keats of Kentucky".

                    Death is the inevitable end of any life form or organism. In the context of the sentence, we believe that it is supposed to mean that the hills get wiser and wiser with every death that happens on the circle of life, this is also indicated because of it being an old hill, meaning that it has “seen” many deaths.

                    Birth is the act of the creation or generation of a life form or an organism. In the context of the sentence, we believe that it is supposed to mean that the hills get wiser with every birth, as birth and death are similar things, one being the ending, the other being the beginning, and both being the only inevitable things in life. The sentence indicates that the hills get older and See more and more circles  of death and birth.

                <h2>FORCE</h2>
                <p><strong>“Behold the silent soul of force.”</strong> <br>
                    Force is one of the fundamental concepts of classical mechanics. Related to Newton's three laws, it is a quantity that has the ability to overcome the inertia of a body, modifying its velocity. As a corollary, one arrives at the construct that force can cause deformation in an object of manipulation. But in the poem it can mean the strength of the spirit or the inner strength of the person, something like that. And strength is also a community in Italy with 1600 inhabitants.

                    A Tree is a plant with a woody trunk whose branches only come out at a certain height from the ground. In biological terms, it is a large, permanently woody plant, with pivoting roots, a woody trunk-like stem, which forms branches well above the ground level.

                    Soul is a very broad term, it can mean "being", "life" or "creature". In the etymology of the word, it comes from the Latin animu, which means "what animates", being life not eternal, nor different from the body. Soul and spirit are different things, in each religion it has its own meaning, and it can be something physical or metaphysical.
                    Soul is often used to refer to the interior of something, its true and profound meaning.
